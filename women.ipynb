    "## Goal\n",
    "My initial question once I started observing the data within Excel, was \"What selected sports had the biggest increase of women players compared to the men players, once the Women's movement started?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "My initial thought process on this topic was: Would be there would be a major increase in women players and a decrease in men players in particular sports? For example, Gymnastics to me, was thought to be a woman dominate sport. So, would the women ultimately dominate and have more players than men in these selected categories? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis \n",
    "I originally had started working off the 9 most played sports by men and compare it to women, but decided it was better to go off the sports that were the most common out of the women players. Those three sports were: Athletics, Gymnastics, and Swimming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon review there was in fact a steady decline of men participants with an increase of women participants throughout the sports, but they stabilized more than women surpassing men players. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the Athletic category trend, it seems that men to women ratio starts to level out around 1984 with 57(m) to 39(w) participants. Then in 2016 both men and women had the same number of participants which is a huge change in 88 years, when women were allowed to compete in 1928. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Gymnastics category, there were roughly 28 women who competed compared to the 60 male players in 1936, which is a 32-player gap compared to the roughly 10 player gap in 2016 (45(w) -> 50(m)) \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Swimming. Women were allowed to compete in swimming events in 1912. Though my graph is slightly skewed and is not showing the number of players, the rate of change is still shown on the graph. It still shows throughout the years that women were slightly behind men in the number of competitors that participated in the events AND it still shows a consistent growth of women in the category as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the 2020 datasets aren't fully out yet, we know that the male to female ratio was the closest it has ever been with 49% female players to 51% male players. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the fight for women equality has proven successful over time but there was not a decrease in male players per sport, there was simply an increase of women that participated within each sport.\n"
